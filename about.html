          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I spent the first 12 years of my working life as a Health Care
            Support Worker in a Forensic Psychiatric Unit with the NHS. However,
            2 years ago I decided to go back to university and enrolled in an
            Arts and Humanities degree focusing on Art History and Music with
            the Open University.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have always been fascinated by coding but never really thought I
            could do it. Just before the Covid Crisis I found
            <a
              href="https://www.shecodes.io/"
              target="_blank"
              class="shecodes-link"
              >SheCodes</a
            >
            who run online Coding Workshops for women. I started their 1st
            course and I'm now on the 3rd. I have learnt so much in such a short
            space of time and they make a sometimes challenging subject fun and
            easy to understand! Also during the Covid Crisis I started painting
            (more on that in 'My Interests').
            <br />
            <br />
            Now I want to put into practice all that I have learnt with art and
            coding to design and develop websites, particularly for creative
            people and businesses like me!

                  As well as being half way through a degree, as mentioned
                  above, I have certificates for the SheCodes Worksops I have
                  completed. I am also working on a couple of courses with Shaw
                  Academy! What can I say? I like learning new things üë©üèº‚Äçüéì!

          <h3>My Interests</h3>
          <p>
            I have many different interests! I am a huge film geek ü§ì, that
            person who everyone comes to for film and TV knowledge (especially
            with Marvel, Harry Potter and Supernatural! üòÉ).
            <br />
            Also, I have a keen interest in singing and Musical Theatre. I have
            been doing lessons since I was 14 years old, have a Diploma in
            Musical Theatre and am working on an Associate Diploma. I would also
            love to learn piano and guitar!
            <br />
            As I hinted above, I have recently started painting. What started as
            something fun and creative to do to replace my usual weekly singing
            lessons while I was unable to attend due to Covid has turned into a
            passion for Oil and Mixed Media painting and drawing and a desire to
            become a professional artist (as well as a Coding Ninja üòâ)!
